## 🎯 Purpose

The **AI Architecture Canvas** is a one-page framework for designing, reviewing, and governing AI systems that are **aligned with business value, technically sound, and ethically responsible**.

It acts as a bridge between business, data, modeling, infrastructure, and governance — a shared map for teams building anything from classical ML to Generative AI.

Think of it as the *Business Model Canvas*, but for AI projects.

## 🧩 Overview

Nine core blocks capture the full lifecycle of an AI system:

| # | Block | Core Question |
|:-:|:------|:---------------|
| 1 | **Business Value & Problem Definition** | Why are we building this AI, and what measurable value does it deliver? |
| 2 | **Data Strategy** | What data do we have, what do we need, and how do we ensure trust and compliance? |
| 3 | **Model Strategy** | Which modeling approach best balances value, explainability, and risk? |
| 4 | **Technical Architecture & Infrastructure** | How will the AI system be deployed, secured, and scaled? |
| 5 | **Integration & Decision Loop** | How will predictions influence real decisions? |
| 6 | **MLOps & Operations** | How do we automate, version, and maintain the lifecycle? |
| 7 | **Monitoring & Governance (Technical)** | How do we ensure reliability, drift detection, and traceability? |
| 8 | **Ethics & Responsibility (Societal)** | How do we ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability? |
| 9 | **Efficiency & Sustainability** | How do we maximize financial and environmental efficiency? |
