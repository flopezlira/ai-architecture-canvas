## 🎯 Purpose

The **AI Architecture Canvas** is a *top-down, human-centered, and evidence-based framework* to guide the architecture of **individual AI projects**.  
Its goal is to ensure that every AI initiative is **aligned with business value**, **technically sound**, **ethically responsible**, and **sustainable over time**.

Inspired by the simplicity of the **Business Model Canvas**, this framework provides a **single-page view** uniting business, data, modeling, infrastructure, governance, and ethics.  
Use it as a **design tool**, a **review checklist**, or a **documentation template** for any AI solution — traditional ML, reinforcement learning, or generative AI.

## 🧩 Canvas Overview

The canvas is organized into **nine core blocks**, each representing a critical aspect of the AI project lifecycle.  
Together, they form a logical flow from *business problem definition* to *long-term sustainability*.

| # | Block | Core Question | Primary Owner |
|:-:|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| 1 | **Business Value & Problem Definition** | Why are we building this AI, and what measurable value does it deliver? | Product Owner / AI Architect |
| 2 | **Data Strategy** | What data do we have, what do we need, and how do we ensure trust and compliance? | Data Engineer / Data Steward |
| 3 | **Model Strategy** | Which modeling approach best balances value, explainability, and risk? | Data Scientist / ML Engineer |
| 4 | **Technical Architecture & Infrastructure** | How will the AI system be deployed, secured, and scaled? | AI Architect / DevOps Engineer |
| 5 | **Integration & Decision Loop** | How will predictions be used in real decisions? | Product Owner / UX / AI Architect |
| 6 | **MLOps & Operations** | How do we automate, version, and maintain the AI lifecycle? | MLOps Engineer / AI Architect |
| 7 | **Monitoring & Governance (Technical)** | How do we ensure reliability, drift detection, and traceability? | ML Engineer / Governance Officer |
| 8 | **Ethics & Responsibility (Societal)** | How do we ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability? | Ethics / Legal / AI Architect |
| 9 | **Efficiency & Sustainability** | How do we maximize financial and environmental efficiency? | FinOps Lead / Sustainability |

## 🧱 Block Summaries (overview)

**1. Business Value & Problem Definition** — frame the real-world problem, stakeholders, KPIs, and success criteria.  
**2. Data Strategy** — define sources, quality metrics, governance roles, lineage, privacy and compliance.  
**3. Model Strategy** — pick approach, metrics, validation, and explainability methods tied to business value.  
**4. Technical Architecture & Infrastructure** — compute, storage, networking, security, deployment patterns (cloud/edge).  
**5. Integration & Decision Loop** — how predictions are consumed; feedback loops to improve decisions.  
**6. MLOps & Operations** — CI/CD/CT, model registry, retraining triggers, rollback, observability.  
**7. Monitoring & Governance (Technical)** — technical & business KPIs, drift/anomaly detection, auditability.  
**8. Ethics & Responsibility (Societal)** — bias testing, transparency, human oversight, consent, escalation paths.  
**9. Efficiency & Sustainability** — TCO/ROI, cost controls, energy and carbon awareness (green AI).

## 🔄 Lifecycle Flow

1 → 2 ↔ 3 ↔ 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9
Design → Build → Deploy → Operate → Govern → Improve

Blocks **2–4** (Data, Model, Architecture) are **iterative** and revisited as new insights emerge.

## 🧭 Next Steps

This baseline is a starting point. Each block can evolve into deeper guidance:
- Practical **checklists** and **templates** (Data Cards, Model Cards, Green Scorecards).  
- A **governance audit** checklist aligned to ISO/IEC standards.  
- A **maturity model** for organizational AI capability.
